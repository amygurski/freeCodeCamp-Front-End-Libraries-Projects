# Random Quote Machine

This is the first project for the front end libraries certificate on freeCodeCamp. I wrote it from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. It was my first time pulling together all I had learned to do something interactive and I love it!

The random quote machine has these main features: 
- When the new quote button is clicked, the quote machine fetches a new quote and author and displays it. 
- You can tweet the current quote by clicking on the tweet quote element.
